# fakefacedetection

- Artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, machine learning and neural networks
represent extremely exciting and powerful machine learning-based techniques used
to solve many real-world problems. Artificial intelligence is the branch of computer
sciences that emphasizes the development of intelligent machines, thinking and
working like humans. For example, recognition, problem-solving, learning, visual
perception, decision-making and planning. Deep learning is a subset of machine
learning in artificial intelligence that has networks capable of learning unsupervised
from data that is unstructured or unlabeled.


- Deep learning is a technique used to generate face detection and recognize it for
real or fake by using profile images and determine the differences between them.
In this study, we used deep learning techniques to generate models for Real and
Fake face detection.


- The goal is determining a suitable way to detect real and fake faces. The model was
designed and implemented, including both Dataset of images: Real and Fake faces
detection through the use of Deep learning algorithms based on neural networks.
We have trained dataset which consists of 5171 images for total in 25 epochs, and
got the ImageNet model to be the best model of network architectures used with
93% training accuracy, 91.45% validation accuracy, training loss 0.0003, validation
loss 0.0265.
